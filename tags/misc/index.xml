in a few days, neglecting to do much of anything else in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of right now, the site&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple &amp;ndash; not as lean as I&amp;rsquo;d like it, but it
gets the job done. I&amp;rsquo;ve still got to finish up the summary and resume page of
the site which will require me dusting off my resume and thinking hard about
what it is I want this site to expose about me.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
