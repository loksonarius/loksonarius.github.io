      I think this was the very first photo I even took with the camera.
      Absolutely fortunate to have bought this skeleton just days before.

      This was my first double-exposure attempt. Used a blanket to make the
      backdrop on the couch.

      This was my wife's first picture. Despite being still, it feels violent.

Late last year, I deep-dove into instant photography. The original idea in my
head was to start blogging and journaling various projects I'd be working on at
a time. The aesthetic of journaling and scrapbooking projects like garage
experiments really settled nicely in my head.

After all of that, I ended up buying a Polaroid Now+. I very quickly came
face-to-face with the hardships of taking good, clear photos of awkward subjects
without any studio setup. Between that and the relative fragility of actual
Polaroid film, the blogging idea went straight into the garbage.

Regardless of the looming buyer's remorse, I started appreciating photography a
lot now that I was getting hands-on experience trying to take shots without only
the assistance of an EV reading. After a few photos here and there, I just
straight up adopted instant photography as a minor hobby. And without the stress
of trying to take "good" photos, I'm kinda just free to see whatever the camera
spits out into my hand. :grin:

All this setup to denote the start of something I'd like to do occasionally
where I select some photos I took, group in a blog post, and maybe talk about
why I care about em. For the first batch: spook hour.

In this batch, we have shots of gag decorations we bought for an upcoming
Halloween party. My favorite is definitely the double-exposure shot of the
skeleton.
