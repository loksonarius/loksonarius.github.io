      I think this was the very first photo I even took with the camera.
      Absolutely fortunate to have bought this skeleton just days before.

      This was my first double-exposure attempt. Used a blanket to make the
      backdrop on the couch.

      This was my wife's first picture. Despite being still, it feels violent.

Late last year, I deep-dove into instant photography. The original idea in my
head was to start blogging and journaling various projects I'd be working on at
a time. The aesthetic of journaling and scrapbooking projects like garage
experiments really settled nicely in my head. After all of that, I ended up
buying a Polaroid Now+ and very quickly came face-to-face with the hardships of
taking good, clear photos of awkward subjects without any studio setup.

Between realizing how challenging photography can be and the relative fragility
of actual Polaroid film itself, the blogging idea went straight into the garbage.
Regardless of that small failure, I started appreciating photography more now
that I was getting hands-on experience, trying to take shots with just the
assistance of an EV reading. And after a few photos here and there, I ended up
adopting instant photography as a minor hobby. And without the stress of trying
to take "good" photos, I'm kinda just free to see whatever the camera spits out
into my hand. :grin:

I share all that as setup for the start of something I'll be committing to for a
bit where I select some photos I took, group them in a blog post, and talk about
the context around them or just some technical details I was focusing on when
taking them. For the first batch: spook hour.

In this batch, we have shots of gag decorations we bought for an upcoming
Halloween party. My favorite is definitely the double-exposure shot of the
skeleton.
