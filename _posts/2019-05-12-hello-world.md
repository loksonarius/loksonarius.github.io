After writing this site for ages, I've finally plopped down and hashed it out
in a few days, neglecting to do much of anything else in the process.

As of right now, the site's pretty simple -- not as lean as I'd like it, but it
gets the job done. I've still got to finish up the summary and resume page of
the site which will require me dusting off my resume and thinking hard about
what it is I want this site to expose about me.

I'll surely put that off for a bit, but at least the blog pages are (mostly) set
up!

This blog will likely collect few personal bits of my progress in Splatoon and
parkour, but I presume it'll act mainly as a journal of my progress on personal
coding projects. Maybe I'll publish tutorials and guides here as well -- I
dunno, there's no real structure! :smile:

Anywho:

    Hello, world!

:tada:
