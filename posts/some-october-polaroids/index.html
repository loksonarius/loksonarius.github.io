head was to start blogging and journaling various projects I&rsquo;d be working on at
a time. The aesthetic of journaling and scrapbooking projects like garage
experiments really settled nicely in my head. After all of that, I ended up
buying a Polaroid Now+ and very quickly came face-to-face with the hardships of
taking good, clear photos of awkward subjects without any studio setup.</p><p>Between realizing how challenging photography can be and the relative fragility
of actual Polaroid film itself, the blogging idea went straight into the garbage.
Regardless of that small failure, I started appreciating photography more now
that I was getting hands-on experience, trying to take shots with just the
assistance of an EV reading. And after a few photos here and there, I ended up
adopting instant photography as a minor hobby. And without the stress of trying
to take &ldquo;good&rdquo; photos, I&rsquo;m kinda just free to see whatever the camera spits out
into my hand. üòÅ</p><p>I share all that as setup for the start of something I&rsquo;ll be committing to for a
bit where I select some photos I took, group them in a blog post, and talk about
the context around them or just some technical details I was focusing on when
taking them. For the first batch: spook hour.</p><p>In this batch, we have shots of gag decorations we bought for an upcoming
Halloween party. My favorite is definitely the double-exposure shot of the
skeleton.</p></article><ul class=photo-list><li><a href=#2023x1jpeg-modal>2023x1.jpeg</a>
