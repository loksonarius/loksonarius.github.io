I haven't writen much of anything for this site, so I feel like the work I put
in to making this nice box to hold my public thoughts is quickly losing value.
To counteract that and try this blog post format out, I document the thought
process behind going from "I can't make this" to "ez stick -- next please".

### The Challenge

So some time ago I gave myself a deadline of June 2020 to pass the level 3
parkour exam at [MFR](http://miamifr.com). The biggest hurdle in that exam is
the glaring 8ft gap I need to clear up over 12ft in the air. This post isn't
about how I committed to that jump, mainly cause I haven't even tried it yet
:skull:.

This post is about replicating this modest turn-around lache pre (as
demonstrated by my coach):

### The Breakdown

There's a lot going on, but the main things for me to focus on are:

- Can I swing from the bar to the wall?
- Can I catch the bar if I jump from the wall?
- Can I execute a turn-around inside the corridor?
- Can I bail safely if I miss the landing?

### The Risks

Given this is all so near the ground, I don't have to worry about taking a drop.
This is a _yuge_ factor when you have a phobia of heights. The only realistic
injuries I have to worry about are:

- Overshoot the jump and land backwards
- Land on my wrists if I bail from the swing
- Undershooting the jump and banging my knees or shinning the wall

### The Plan

So then, with all this in mind, I have the following checklist of things to work
through:

- Bounce back from a far jump
  - Do it from a swing
  - Include a small drop
- Catch a bar mid air
  - Swing from it
- Turn-around in place on a bar
  - Swing from it

### The Process

I've only really started committing to bouncebacks recently, but I'm comfortable
enough with what I have already for this challenge:

The idea of approaching the ground primed for a face plant still shakes me, so
the bar grabs will be crucial. There's gonna be a bit more work up involved in
this part:

The turn around is just gonna be about practice:

### The Attempt

So putting it all together, here's what I got:

:tada: **woo** :tada:

This was pretty satisfying to accomplish given how long I had put it off.
Pushing challenges like these helps a ton with expanding my boundaries and
enabling me to try even scarier challenges in the future.

I don't know if this is actually helpful to anyone out there, but at the very
least I'd hope it was entertaining to see the process. :sweat_smile:
