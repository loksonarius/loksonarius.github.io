There’s two severity layers to the fear:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Anxiety of being idled and potentially missing out on some form of consumption
or recreation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Severe anxiety of being forced to be minimally stimulated and attentive
without being able to disengage for long periods of time&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>While the latter is just something I’ve come to work around in life, the former
is a trained response. I know for a fact I didn’t have it before the age of 12
and at some point between my teenage years and my adult life, I lost the ability
to be comfortably bored. I think at some point as my responsibilities grew and
my sanctioned free time shrunk, I came to associate idleness with some
opportunity cost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>write, bro, write</title><link>https://hato.me/posts/write-bro-write/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:33:21 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hato.me/posts/write-bro-write/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m forcing myself from the time I’ve started writing this to not switch
contexts. From the time it took me to start that last sentence to the time I
finished, I stood up and went to watch a Monster Hunter Wilds video my wife
wanted to show me. :v:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve got a very strong desire to write more entries for this space I’ve made,
but I have this massive inertia to just start and iterate on the ideas I wanna
capture. I’ve got this idea now, though, that if I just start writing as if I
were yapping in-person to someone, then it’ll be way easier to build that
writing muscle.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
