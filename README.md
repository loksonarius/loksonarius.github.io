If you're pulling this repo down as reference or want to mess around with it
locally, I recommend this workflow to test changes after cloning the repo:

```bash
# Setup Gem dependencies
> bundle

# Serve website locally
> bundle exec jekyll serve -H localhost

# Make changes that get auto-published
> vscode . # or vim . or etc, etc, etc
```

If you have suggestions on optimizations, edits, typos, or features, please
leave an issue or pull request in this repo for me to address! I particularly
care about things like usability and resource efficiency, so if you notice
something I can do better in those departments, don't hesitate to reach out!
